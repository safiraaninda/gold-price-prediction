# Forecasting Gold Prices with Machine Learning

## 🌐 About
In a personal project focused on time series and forecasting, I researched and applied various quantitative methods to predict gold prices.

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project was to forecast future gold prices using historical data. I applied various quantitative methods, including moving averages and machine learning models, to predict gold prices based on the dataset. 

## 🚀 Objectives
1. **Exploring and Preprocessing Data**: Analyze and prepare the data for the training and testing phases. The data is split 80% for training and 20% for testing.
2. **Model Building**: Use regression models like Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The best accuracy will be selected.
3. **Prediction and Analysis**: The model is used to predict gold prices on the test data (2017-2018). The predicted results are then compared with the actual data to evaluate the model's performance.
